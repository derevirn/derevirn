### Welcome to my Github Profile!
I am a data scientist who is passionate about machine learning and data visualization. My goal is to utilize data science to mitigate climate change and help accomplish the UN Sustainable Development Goals. I am also a [contributing writer](https://giannistolios.medium.com/) at established websites such as Towards Data Science and Analytics Vidhya. Furthermore, I have published a book titled [Simplifying Machine Learning with PyCaret](https://leanpub.com/pycaretbook/), that quickly became a best seller at Leanpub and got cited in scientific papers. I am also experienced in quantitative academic research in the field of climate change mitigation, with papers in top-tier journals like Nature. I encourage you to check my data science portfolio below, or visit my [personal website](https://giannis.io/) for more details about me.
