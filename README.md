## Welcome to my Github Profile! ðŸ“Š

I am a data scientist who is passionate about machine learning and data visualization. My goal is to utilize data science to mitigate climate change, air pollution, deforestation and help accomplish the UN sustainable development goals. I am also a [contributing writer](https://giannistolios.medium.com/) at established websites such as Towards Data Science and Analytics Vidhya. Furthermore, I have also published a book titled [Simplifying Machine Learning with PyCaret](https://leanpub.com/pycaretbook/), that quickly became a best seller at Leanpub. I encourage you to check my data science portfolio below, or visit my [personal website](https://giannis.io/) for more details about me.
