## Welcome to my Github Page! ðŸ“ˆðŸ“Š

I am passionate about data science, machine learning and data visualization. My goal is to be involved in projects that utilize data science to mitigate climate change, air pollution and help accomplish the UN sustainable development goals in general. I am also a [contributing writer](https://giannistolios.medium.com/) at established websites such as Towards Data Science and Analytics Vidhya. Furthermore, I have published a book titled Simplifying Machine Learning with PyCaret, that quickly became a best seller at Leanpub. You can see more information at the [official book website](https://leanpub.com/pycaretbook/) or the associated [repository](https://github.com/derevirn/pycaret-book). I also encourage you to check my data science portfolio below, or visit my [personal website](https://giannis.io/) for more details about me.
