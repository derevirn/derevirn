### Welcome to my Github Page!

I am passionate about data science, machine learning and data visualization. My goal is to be involved in projects that utilize data science to mitigate climate change, air pollution and help achieve the sustainable development goals in general. I am also a contributor at established websites such as Towards Data Science and Analytics Vidhya. Feel free to check my portfolio of projects, or visit my [personal website](https://giannis.io/) for more details about me.
